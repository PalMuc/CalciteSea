## Description

This repository contains the supplementary material for: 
Conci N., Griesshaber E., Rivera-Vicéns R., Schmahl W., Vargas S. and Wӧrheide G (2022) ** Molecular and mineral responses of corals grown under artificial Calcite Sea conditions ** ADD DETAILS ONCE PREPRINTED


## Repository Content

S.Mat 1: salt composition used to prepare artifical seawaters with mMg:MCa of ratio 5.2, 2.5 and 1.5. 

S.Mat 2: the DESeq2 (package version 1.24.0, R version 3.6.0) used for gene expression analysis.

S.Mat 3: folder containing the gene expression analysis output. For each species table files with the expression data (csv format) and list of differentially expressed genes (Fasta format) are provided. The former include one file for the control vs. treatment mMg:MCa 2.5 and one for control vs. treatment 1.5. Here positive log fold change values  indicate underexpression in treatment, while negative values refers to genes overexpressed in treatment conditions. 

S.Mat 4: TO ADD
